To talk to the room in your plugins, you'll want to use the \nself.say()\n method.\n\n\n@respond_to(\nbonjour\n)\ndef say_bonjour_will(self, message):\n    # Awesome stuff\n    self.say(\nBonjour!\n, message=message)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we pass \nmesssage\n along.  This allows will to route his reply to the correct room.  Without it, he'll just speak to the \nDEFAULT_ROOM\n.\n\n\nsay()\n comes with a number of options, including color, html, and ping notify. \n\n\nself.say(content, message=None, room=None, html=False, color=\ngreen\n, notify=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent\n: the content you want to send to the room.

Default is \"green\". \n\n\nnotify\n: whether the message should trigger a 'ping' notification. \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nReply with a mention\n\n\nSometimes you want will to ping you - that's where @name mentions are great.

If you've set \nDEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL\n, \nMAILGUN_API_URL\n, and \nMAILGUN_API_KEY\n, you can use \nself.send_email()\n\n\n@respond_to(\nstatus report\n)\ndef send_status_report(self):\n    self.send_email(email_list=['jill@example.com'], subject=\nHere's the latest report\n, message=rendered_template(\nreport.html\n, {}))\n\n\n\n\nHere's all the options:\n\n\nself.send_email(from_email=None, email_list=[], subject=\n, message=\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom_email\n: (Optional) The email address the message should come from.

He should respond to ping. :)\n\n\n\n\nSay\n\n\nThis provides a web endpoint at \n/say/some-phrase\n that will will speak into \nDEFAULT_ROOM\n.  Helpful for pay-no-attention-to-the-hand-behind-the-curtain demos.\n\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\nProvides several \nadmin-only\n commands for manipulating will's underlying storage.  These methods are also case-sensitive, because they can do Bad Things.\n\n\n\n\n@will How big is the db?\n: Lists the db size in human-friendly units.\n\n\n@will SERIOUSLY.

Will will definitely not work after this without a restart, and will tell you so.\n\n\n@will Show me the storage for ____\n: Shows the raw storage value for a given key.\n\n\n\n\nChat rooms\n\n\nProvides a couple of methods for listing and updating will's internal chat room knowledge, and manipulating the current room.\n\n\n\n\n@will what are the rooms?\n:  List the rooms he knows about, including their hipchat IDs.\n\n\n@will who is in this room?\n: List all the participants of the room he's in, including their name and mention name. \n\n\n@will update the room list\n:  Get a new list of rooms from the chat server.\n\n\n@will new topic ____\n:   Set the room topic.\n\n\n\n\nDevops\n\n\nWill is our devops team at GreenKahuna, and in the long term, we plan to abstract and include our stack deployer as a plugin.

Get one full access api key from https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.pagerduty.com/api_keys.\n\n\nThis plugin assumes that your PagerDuty e-mail address and your HipChat e-mail address are the same, this is how will associates your HipChat account with PagerDuty account.\n\n\nAcknowledge\n\n\nYou can acknowledge the ongoing incidents. You can do 3 things:\n\n\n\n\n@will pd ack\n: Acknowledge all open incidents assigned to you\n\n\n@will pd ack!\n: Acknowledge all open incidents\n\n\n@will pd ack [incident number 1] [incident number 2]\n: Acknowledge one or more specific incidents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolve\n\n\nYou can resolve the acknowledged incidents.

            "text": "Deploying your Will\n\n\nWill's happy to run on your machine all day, every day.  But he really shines out in production where he can run independently of anything you do with your local machine.  Here are some best practices for deploying will.\n\n\nDeploy on Heroku\n\n\nHeroku is our recommended platform for deployment because it's simple, easy, and free. That's a tough combination to beat.  You're in no way locked in to running will on heroku, though - run him wherever you want!\n\n\nStep 1: Set up your heroku app, and a redis addon.\n\n\nAssuming you have the \nheroku toolbelt\n installed and all set up, it's as easy as this:\n\n\nheroku create our-will-name\nheroku addons:add rediscloud\n\n\n\n\nA note on rediscloud: you can also use redistogo, openredis, or anyone else.  We use rediscloud and like them.\n\n\nStep 2: Add all the needed environment variables:\n\n\nYou'll want to take all the variables that live in your virtualenv's \npostactivate\n file that feed into your will environment, and provide them to your heroku app.\n\n\nAt minimum, that's\n\n\nheroku config:set \\\nWILL_PUBLIC_URL=\nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n \\\nWILL_USERNAME='12345_123456@chat.hipchat.com' \\\nWILL_PASSWORD='asj2498q89dsf89a8df' \\\nWILL_V2_TOKEN='asdfjl234jklajfa3azfasj3afa3jlkjiau' \\\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than 30 chat rooms, you must also set the V1 token to avoid hipchat rate limits:\n\n\nheroku config:set WILL_V1_TOKEN='kjadfj89a34878adf78789a4fae3'\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for will's schedule to be correct, you need to set him to the time zone you want:\n\n\nheroku config:set TZ=\nAmerica/Los_Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n You don't have to worry about setting the \nREDIS_URL\n or \nHTTPSERVER_PORT\n.  Will auto-detects those and takes care of it.\n\n\nStep 3: Deploy!\n\n\nYou're all set to deploy your will. Ready? Go!\n\n\ngit push heroku\n\n\n\n\nYou app is now up on heroku.  Finally, turn it on!\n\n\nheroku scale web=1\n\n\nThat should be it - head over to \nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n, and you should see will's smiling face.\n\n\nIf so, pop into chat, and give a:\n\n\n\n\nDeploying future updates\n\n\nJust commit your updates, then\n\n\ngit push heroku\n\n\n\n\nSimple.  For best-practices, see our continuous deployment recommendations below.\n\n\nDepoly in Docker\n\n\nWill is packaged with a Dockerfile and docker-compose files to allow deploying in a container with redis. \n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nYou should have docker already installed; additionally, the instructions require docker-compose.  If you're not using docker-compose, you must start the image via the docker command with the correct arguments.\n\n\nStep 1: Configure your container's environment variables\n\n\nIn Will's docker directory, update the default.env file with your environment's settings.  At a minimum, this should contain:\n\n\nWILL_USERNAME\nWILL_PASSWORD\nWILL_V2_TOKEN\n\n\n\n\nNote, we've pre-defined the redis url and the HTTP Server port; if you update these values, make sure you update the docker-compose file accordingly. \n\n\nStep 2: Deploy your plugins and templates\n\n\nIf you have any custom templates, create directories for your plugins and templates, and load your plugins and templates they'll be mounted when the container starts up giving your contanerized bot access to your templates.\n\n\nmkdir ./plugins ./templates\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Build will.\n\n\nRun build your docker image locally.\n\n\ndocker-compose build \n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Start the container\n\n\nStart your image from docker-compose using:\n\n\ndocker-compose up \n\n\n\n\nor to run the container in the background,\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\nDeploy Everywhere Else\n\n\nWill is Just Python\n\n\nThat says it all. Will is just python, and you can deploy him \nanywhere\n you have python, an open port, and access to redis.\n\n\nIn your chosen deploy environment and setup, you'll want to do a couple things:\n\n\nReplicate your environment settings\n\n\nAt minimum, that's:\n\n\nexport WILL_PUBLIC_URL=\nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n\nexport WILL_USERNAME='12345_123456@chat.hipchat.com'\nexport WILL_PASSWORD='asj2498q89dsf89a8df'\nexport WILL_V2_TOKEN='asdfjl234jklajfa3azfasj3afa3jlkjiau'\nexport WILL_REDIS_URL='redis://some-domain.com/7/'\nexport WILL_HTTPSERVER_PORT='80'\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than 30 chat rooms, you must also set the V1 token to avoid hipchat rate limits:\n\n\nexport WILL_V1_TOKEN='kjadfj89a34878adf78789a4fae3'\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to set any environment variables for your plugins.\n\n\nCall run_will with something that handles restarts and crashes.\n\n\nThe command to kick off will is just:\n\n\npython run_will.py\n\n\n\n\nYou can run that with whatever supervisory process you'd like. Will's very, very stable, but having something that handles crashes is still a pretty good idea.\n\n\nAlternate approach\n\n\nAh, you say, but I have this crazy python-twisted-zope-node monolith that self-repairs mars and can do everything. Why do I need the shell at all?\n\n\nAnswer, crazy monolith mars person: you don't.  Will is Just Python.\n\n\nfrom will.main import WillBot\n\nbot = WillBot()\nbot.bootstrap()\n\n\n\n\nand you're good.\n\n\nStorage Backends\n\n\nWill's default storage backend is Redis, but he supports some others if you can't run Redis.\n\n\nTo change the backend, just set \nSTORAGE_BACKEND\n in \nconfig.py\n and then supply any other needed settings for the new storage backend.  The currently supported backends are:\n\n\n\n\nredis\n - The default Redis backend\n\n\ncouchbase\n - A Couchbase backend\n\n\nfile\n - Keeps the settings as files on a local filesystem\n\n\n\n\nCouchbase\n\n\nCouchbase requries you set \nCOUCHBASE_URL\n in your config.\n\n\nYou are also required to have the python Couchbase client (and thus, libcouchbase) installed.  If you are installing for development you can use \npip install -r requirements.couchbase.txt\n to pull in the Couchbase client.  See \nthe Python Couchbase client repo\n for more info.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase:///bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://hostname/bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://host1,host2/bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://hostname/bucket?password=123abc\ntimeout=5'\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nFile requires you set \nFILE_DIR\n in your config to point to an empty directory.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nFILE_DIR='/var/run/will/settings/'\n\n\nFILE_DIR='~will/settings/'\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\nIn this section, we describe how we deploy and host will, in the hopes that others come forward and share what's working for them, too.  The more good practices, the better.\n\n\nOur Stack\n\n\nWe host on heroku, using rediscloud for redis, mailgun for email, and things have been peachy.  We deploy via CD using CircleCI. Details on that below.\n\n\nUse Continuous Deployment\n\n\nOur stack is set up so that any pushes on will's master branch have tests run on \nCircleCI\n, and if they pass, a new version is deployed to heroku immediately.  This has been delightful. Even though will has very, very minimal tests, we generally catch if things are horribly broken, and it's meant that adding new functionality to will takes minutes, sometimes seconds of developer time.\n\n\nContinuous Deployment has dramatically changed how we build and use will - instead of talking about \"what if will did...\", generally, people just implement it, push it, and play with it for real.  It's been a great place to be.  It might be for you too.\n\n\nThat's it in getting your will up and running!   But maybe you're one of those people who wants to pitch in and make will even better. Awesome. Learn \nhow to improve will\n.",

He wouldn't exist without all of them.\n\n\nWe also welcome new contributions no matter how big or small.  Interested in contributing to will? We'd love to have you. Details below.\n\n\nOur Culture\n\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to will, regardless of skill level or experience.  To make will the best he can be, we have one big, overriding cultural principle:\n\n\nBe kind.\n\n\nSimple.  Easy, right?\n\n\nWe've all been newbie coders, we've all had bad days, we've all been frustrated with libraries, we've all spoken a language we learned later in life.  In discussions with other coders, PRs, and CRs, we just give each the benefit of the doubt, listen well, and assume best intentions.  It's worked out fantastically.\n\n\nThis doesn't mean we don't have honest, spirited discussions about the direction to move will forward, or how to implement a feature.  We do.  We just respect one other while we do it.  Not so bad, right? :)\n\n\nImprove will's core\n\n\nFor big core features, you're probably best off opening an issue, and discussing it with one of the core developers \nbefore\n you hack your nights and weekends away.\n\n\nCore changes to will are very much welcome.  In some cases, proposed changes have already been thought through, and there may be gotchas or sticking points we couldn't get past.  In other cases, it might be a direction we've purposely decided not to take will.  In most cases, we simply haven't thought of it, and would love the improvement!\n\n\nIt's always great to get a heads up of what's coming down the pipe, and have an open dialog.  Thanks for reaching out and starting one!\n\n\nIn terms of the mechanics, you'll just want to:\n\n\n\n\nFork this repo.\n\n\nClone down a copy, set up redis and the env, as before.\n\n\nRun \n./start_dev_will.py\n to start up just core will.\n\n\n\n\nContribute new plugins\n\n\nThis one's pretty simple. Write good, clean code that does one thing well, document it properly, and submit a PR!\n\n\nTo submit a plugin that's running in your will,\n\n\n\n\nFork this repo.\n\n\nClone down a copy, set up redis and the env, as before.\n\n\npip install -r requirements.dev.txt\n\n\nCopy your plugin and docs over to the core will repo,\n\n\nRun \n./start_dev_will.py\n to start up just core will, and test it out!\n\n\n\n\nCode standards and PRs\n\n\nThis one's hopefully straightforward:\n\n\n\n\nIncoming code should follow PEP8\n\n\nIf you add new core-level features, please add documentation in the \ndocs\n folder (we use mkdocs).  If you're not sure if they're needed, just ask!\n\n\nPlease add your name and attribution to the AUTHORS file.\n\n\nKnow you have our thanks for helping to make will even better!\n\n\n\n\nTests\n\n\nShamefully, tests are just getting rolling, and a proper, well-architected test harness is in the works. However, there are \nsome\n tests you can run by running:\n\n\ncoverage run -m nose\n\n\n\n\nMore soon!\n\n\nThe Shoulders of Giants\n\n\nWill leverages some fantastic libraries.  He wouldn't exist without them.\n\n\n\n\nBottle\n for http handling,\n\n\nJinja\n for templating,\n\n\nSleekxmpp\n for listening to xmpp,\n\n\nnatural\n and \nparsedatetime\n for natural date parsing,\n\n\napscheduler\n for scheduled task parsing,\n\n\nRequests\n to make http sane.\n\n\n\n\nWill was originally written and is maintained by \nSteven Skoczen\n.  Credit to GreenKahuna (now defunct) and \nBuddyUp\n for supporting those efforts with on-the-job time.\n\n\nWill's also has had help from lots of coders.

Bottle  for http handling,  Jinja  for templating,  Sleekxmpp  for listening to xmpp,  natural  and  parsedatetime  for natural date parsing,  apscheduler  for scheduled task parsing,  Requests  to make http sane.   Will was originally written and is maintained by  Steven Skoczen .  Credit to GreenKahuna (now defunct) and  BuddyUp  for supporting those efforts with on-the-job time.  Will's also has had help from lots of coders. Alphabetically:   adamcin  gave you html support in 1-1 chats, using the new v2 API, and made bootstrapping more reliable.  adamgilman  gave you the friendly error messages when the hipchat key was invalid.  antgel  fixed the image plugin, for reals and added awesome documentation.  amckinley  fixed a bug in the hipchat user list from missing params.  bfhenderson  removed dependence on the v1 token, and made help more friendly.  borgstrom  gave you beautifully architected storage backends, including support for couchbase and local storage.  brandonsturgeon  jumped on hipchat's API-breaking change, and made will immune in a flash.  Improved the docs all over, too.  BrianGallew  improved the blacklist import mechanism, so blacklisted modules aren't even attempted to be imported, taught will to handle zombie users with grace, and fixed the file storage backend.  bsvetchine  fixed a bug with README generation.  buran  added HTML support to 1-1 messages.  carsongee  pooled your redis connections.  camilonova  fixed the  @randomly  decorator, and brought the joy of more pugs to your life.  He's also reported several important bugs.  ckcollab  was one of the original contributors, when will was first built at GreenKahuna.  charlax  gave us batch-get of rooms via the V2 API.  chillipeper  fixed up the max-size and handling of V2 rooms, and taught will how to use bottle's  custom_filters .  crccheck  gave you friendly error messages if your  WILL_ROOMS  was wrong.  d0ugal  fixed up the docs to meet the new mkdocs standard.  danbourke  submitted a fix for the  2000 rooms bug, and kept Will happy.  derek-adair  found a solution for the duplicated 'hi' messages.  dpoirier  figured out how to properly ignore the initial catch-up messages, and gave you log-level control.  dmuntean  gave you proxy support, and kept it working..  Ironykins  brought you urban dictionary support.  kenden  fixed up the redis docs for ubuntu/debian.  jbeluch  found a bug with  get_roster  not populating in time.  jcdyer  made the  _available_rooms  object consistent across API versions.  jessamynsmith  was kind enough to port  talkbackbot  over, at my request, then kept it updated through version changes.  jquast  did the noble and oft unappreciated work of spelling fixes.  keNzi  added shorten url function using bitly service.  levithomason  was one of the original contributors, when will was first built at GreenKahuna.  mark-adams  cleaned up a Bitbucket typo.  mike-love  added Docker support to make running Will easier!  hobson  made setup.py more robust across operating systems, and improved the docs.  neronmoon  made it easier to mention will with non-standard case  michaeljoseph  suggested improvements to setup and requirements.txt format.  mrgrue  added support for the hipchat server beta.  mvanbaak  brought you support for bitbucket uptime.  netjunkie  fixed a duplicated help module, added an expire parameter to  self.save() , added support for will watching hipchat's status. and fixed some redis config bugs.  pcurry  added travis support.  pepedocs  added friendly timestamps to the default logging output.  PrideRage  gave you access to a room's entire history, and suggested a better talkback regex.  quixeybrian  wrote the awesome new help system and stopped the rate limit nightmare.  Regner  upgraded the hiredis version to work on windows.  rbp  added the  admin_only  argument, and fixed a bug with  room  not being passed along properly to messages.  shadow7412  cleaned up a bunch of regex, and fixed up  image me  after google pulled the free API.  sivy  added a config flag for disabling SSL, and the ability to look up a user by nickname.  tenzer  added python 3 support!  tomokas  fixed a bug in the  @randomly  decorator.  tophsic  made help friendlier, including plugin-specific help.  wohali  tracked down the annoying DNS thread issue, and got will on the right path.  woohgit  added support for the v2 WorldWeatherOnline API, and fixed it when I broke it, and then fixed it again when they changed their endpoint.  He also taught will how to say his version number.  And  remind ___ to ___ at ___ .  Awesome. And fixed lots of docs.  And put the time zone with \"what time is it?\".  And then added an entire Pagerduty workflow.  And made message parsing more reliable.  And wrote the ACL support.  And even more doc fixes. And improvements on uptime monitoring edge cases. And kept Pagerduty working. And added  append  and  pop  list support. And ditched WorldWeatherOnline when it started to hurt. Yep.  wontonst  made it simple to have will reply to a specific room.  woparry  made sure that Will could handle organizations with a massive ( 2000) number of rooms.",

The core of the company is around an idea we call Personal AI.\n\n\n(Read more about the mission at \nhttp://heywill.io/mission\n.)\n\n\nThis shift means growing the project to something much bigger than a hipchat bot, and into a write-once, run anywhere platform for chat bots, AIs, and fun new holy-crap-that's-amazing ideas.\n\n\nThe big goal is to provide an easy-to-build-on batteries-included platform that bridges modes of communication (HipChat, Slack, SMS, Email, Telegram, FB Messenger, etc) with services (IFTTT, Amazon AI, IBM Watson, Google APIs, etc) and built-in AI tools (NLP, ML, DL, etc).  \n\n\nThis broader platform serves as an OS for AI development, and has the tremendously creative working name of AIOS.\n\n\nDevelopers can build AIOS apps (our current plugins) for will using any and all of those tools, and run them on their personal wills or distribute them to a broader audience.\n\n\nWill the company will focus, like Wordpress, on running the PaaS and SaaS platforms, and a marketplace for apps.  Our goal is to keep Will development brisk, bring in talented folks across the spectrum, and keep Will available to anyone, anywhere on the planet, regardless of financial or technical access. \n\n\nProject Roadmap\n\n\nHere's the nuts and bolts of how, today, we see this rolling out.\n\n\n0.9.4 - Just released, catches up almost all open PRs\n\n\n1.0 - Soon, closes up existing issues, code cleanup and prep for improvements\n\n\n1.2 - Slack Support, \nIOBackend\n documented and working.

TBD, but considered: (Image me, Remind me, Groceries, News Summary, Scattegories, Stale Package Finder)\n\n\n2.0 - App Marketplace released, Git library integration released, and all existing Will plugins released as AIOS apps.\n\n\n2.0+ - \"The root of all evil is premature optimization.\"  Releases after 2.0 are likely to move in a direction of improved AIOS features, more built-in AI tools, smarter and richer message processing and context, cross-app communication, and speed/reliability bumps.
